# .dotfiles 

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This collection houses all the configuration files, customizations, and themes that I use to tailor my Linux and macOS environments for an optimal experience. 

## Overview ‚ú®

- **Configuration Files üìù:**  
  All my config files for various applications (shell, editor, window manager, etc.) are version-controlled and organized here for easy setup and maintenance.

- **Customizations ‚öôÔ∏è:**  
  From aliases and environment variables to plugin settings and system tweaks, you'll find everything I use to streamline my workflow.

- **Themes and Aesthetics üé®:**  
  I include various themes and visual customizations to create a consistent and visually appealing environment across all my systems.

- **Automation and Scripts ‚ö°:**  
  Custom scripts and bootstrap tools automate the setup process, making it simple to deploy my personalized environment on any new machine.

## Quick Start üöÄ

1. **(macOS only) Install Apple‚Äôs Command Line Tools:**  
   If you‚Äôre on macOS, install these prerequisites (needed for Git and Homebrew):
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ``` 

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   # Use SSH (if set up)...
   git clone git@github.com:UBONGFX/.dotfiles.git

   # ...or else use HTTP and switch to remote later.
   git clone https://github.com/username/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

3. **Install Homebrew Packages & Apps:**  
   Bootstrap Homebrew itself (if missing), then install your formulae, casks, and fonts.  
   - **Default (no flag):** installs **everything** (base + office casks + private casks + fonts)  
   - **`--base`:** only core formulae + base casks + fonts  
   - **`--office`:** base + office casks  
   - **`--private`:** base + private casks
   - **Note (Linux):** on Linux the script always runs in default mode but installs only core formulae (casks and fonts are not supported) 
   ```bash
   cd ~/.dotfiles

   # Default (all, macOS only):
   source ./scripts/brew-bootstrap.sh

   # Or limit to base only (also the only mode on Linux):
   source ./scripts/brew-bootstrap.sh --base

   # Or include office GUI apps only:
   source ./scripts/brew-bootstrap.sh --office

   # Or install private casks only:
   source ./scripts/brew-bootstrap.sh --private
   ```

4. **Run the Dotfiles Bootstrap Script:**  
   Back up any existing dotfiles and create symlinks to your repo.  
   - **Normal mode** (default): moves old files to a backup folder and replaces them with symlinks.  
   - **Soft mode** (`--soft`): preserves any existing files in place (no backup or linking).  
   ```bash
   # Use this to force changes...
   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh

   # ..or use it with the soft flag
   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh --soft
   ```

5. **Set Your Login Shell to Homebrew¬†Zsh:**  
   Ensure you‚Äôre running the Homebrew‚Äëinstalled Zsh as your default login shell:  
   - 	Registers the brew‚Äëinstalled Zsh in /etc/shells if needed.
	-	Runs chsh to update your login shell.
	-	Enter your password when prompted to authorize the change.
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/set_shell.sh
   ```

6. **Reload or Restart Your Shell:**  
   For all changes to take effect, either open a new terminal window or reload your current session with:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

Configuration done. Wishing you smooth coding! üëç
